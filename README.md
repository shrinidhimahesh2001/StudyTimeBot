# StudyTimeBot
I was casually stream-hopping on various "lo-fi beats" channels on Youtube, when a bot on one of those channels inspired me to create my own timekeeper bot as I simultaneously felt guilty about skipping college work to enjoy some nice beats

_What it does_
This Discord Bot currently greets the user and shows the current time, but I hope to add more timekeeping features such as the minutes I spent on discord playing with other bots(such as Taco Shack), and possibly some motivational messages to help me study.
